# My notes for the Udacity course: [Web Tooling & Automation](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud892)

Just one of the things I'm learning. https://github.com/hchiam/learning

## Look for in build tools:

1. Fast -> (sustains state of flow)
2. Community -> (makes it easy to find answers)
3. Feature-rich -> (solves common problems out-of-the-box)
4. Modular and Extensible -> (lets you solve custom problems specific to your project)

- Grunt is currently most popular, but:
- [gulp.js](https://github.com/hchiam/learning-gulp) is fast and can run tasks in parallel, and you can create/extend tasks with normal JavaScript.

Look at next:

## Scaffolding:

Automate the automation. If you create a lot similar projects, it helps to use templates/boilerplates that you can do a (fancy) "copy-and-paste":

- [html5boilerplate](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate) (beginner): JS/HTML/CSS, jQuery, etc., and non-opinionated but no build tool.
- Web Starter Kit (intermediate): opinionated, and comes with build config, live editing, etc., but won't fit every project.
- Yeoman (advanced): most flexible with generators that ask you questions. My own personal example: https://github.com/hchiam/generator-hchiam-learning
