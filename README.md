# My notes for the Udacity course: [Web Tooling & Automation](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud892)

Just one of the things I'm learning. https://github.com/hchiam/learning

## Look for in build tools:

1. Fast -> (sustains state of flow)
2. Community -> (makes it easy to find answers)
3. Feature-rich -> (solves common problems out-of-the-box)
4. Modular and Extensible -> (lets you solve custom problems specific to your project)
